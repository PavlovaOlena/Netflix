My dashboard on Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/olena.pavlova4958/viz/Netflix_17292555930740/Netflix#1

This dashboard was created to explore key questions about Netflix’s growth and production trends. It aims to answer:

When did Netflix become one of the largest producers of movies and series?
Which countries contribute the most to Netflix's content production?
What is the average length of Netflix movies?
Does Netflix produce more series or movies?
Which genres are the most popular on the platform?
The project was developed using Tableau, formulas, and Excel to analyze data and present insights effectively. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of Netflix’s content strategy, focusing on trends over time, regional production, and genre preferences.
